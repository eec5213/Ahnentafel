    All things run smoothly: error checks all work, documentation is clean, etc... Final commit

    Everything is running fine! Just doing last minute formatting checks, tests, and documentation cleanup

    No more error when taking inputs from the menu, but relateToInt() is still struggling to work when taking more than 2 generations from the command line. Otherwise, all error checks, documentation, and other functions complete

    Nothing has changed, but note: relateToInt() only seems to work for up to 2 generations of relations, and any longer entries are read as invalid strings for some reason

    Documentation and all other functions are cleaned up. relateToInt() is still behaving strange but only need to fix that one it seems...

    relateToInt() is still a bit finnicky, but otherwise all functions appear to be working properly. Need to check if I need to add any more error checking. Need to delete checkpoint testing print lines as well as clean up any messy documentation

    I realize while working on command line arguments that the relate() function was behaving a bit finnicky and kept indexing the binary values in the reverse order so I fixed that. relateToBi() is still unreliable so I need to fix that too. Continuing working on command line handling and will implement error checking as I go. Also need to remember to add documentation for new functions I added.

    Prompts 1, 2, 3, and 5 are running appropriately. Documentation is a little bit neater. Need to implement prompt 4 and handle command line argument cases

    Fixed an error in which the menu prompt kept on double printing in output and stderr "Unknown Operation" message kept on persistently printing no matter what input

    Functions to convert to and from decimal/binary written and implemented. Menu printing has been implemented in a separate function to declutter the main function.

    Global variable input[] deleted, and documentation for each function added. Will work on functions individually from here on out

    Runs without errors. Need to have the program actually do stuff now...

    input[] changed to a global variable, and minimal code written out for all functions. Main function is split into two components: loop component in the case of no command line arguments, and a one-time run component in the case there are command line arguments.

    Initial Commit: stubbed out code and basic functions having to do with main()
